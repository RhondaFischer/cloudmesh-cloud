# Install

In this directory you find examples of install scripts


Scripts:

* `windows-install.bat` - installs cloudmesh in windows. You nee to 
   change some attributes
   
* `windows-command.bat` - installs new cloudmaeh command
   in windows. THis script is realy now needed as a one line 
   command in cloudmesh does this. The script only adds insstalling 
   and running the command as a reminder how to do this as
   discussed in the manual
